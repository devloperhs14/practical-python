'''
Equal Substring Finder!

Given an input string:

If it's odd in length, keep it.
If it's even:
    Remove the last character if it's a period.
    Add a period if the last character isn't a period.

Then: 
    Find a substring of three consecutive characters from the modified string.
    Ensure there's an equal number of characters to the left and right of this substring.
    Print this substring.

    e.g: example. -> example -> amp
